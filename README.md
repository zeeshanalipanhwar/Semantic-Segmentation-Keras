# Semantic-Segmentation-Keras
Different CNNs for Semantic Segmentation using Keras

"Semantic segmentation, or image segmentation, is the task of clustering parts of an image together which belong to the same object class. It is a form of pixel-level prediction because each pixel in an image is classified according to a category.

Some example benchmarks for this task are Cityscapes, PASCAL VOC and ADE20K. Models are usually evaluated with the Mean Intersection-Over-Union (Mean IoU) and Pixel Accuracy metrics." -- https://paperswithcode.com/task/semantic-segmentation

# Problem Statement:
To implement an image degmentation pipeline using CNNs to get sementic understanding of the images.


**Monuseg dataset** (available [here](https://monuseg.grand-challenge.org/Data/)) is downloaded and the ground truth segmentation masks are created. The dataset can be either obtained from the instructor or can be downloaded from [this](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hnHjxFb52BdhxkcV_N7MdWLdagzXHzmq?usp=sharing) Google Drive link.
